🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis – Cognifyz Technologies Internship

This project was developed as part of my internship at Cognifyz Technologies under the role of Data Analysis Intern. The goal was to explore a restaurant dataset using Python and extract meaningful insights that can support business decision-making.

📌 Project Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a restaurant dataset and answer key business questions like:

🔑 What keywords are most often associated with positive and negative restaurant reviews?

💸 How does the price range impact services like online delivery and table booking?

🗳️ What is the distribution of votes (reviews), and how do they correlate with ratings?
